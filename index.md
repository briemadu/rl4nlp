## Description
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm that is becoming more popular for Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this seminar, we will cover recent literature that apply RL to different NLP tasks, discussing how NLP problems can be modeled with RL concepts and comparing the results to other traditional or common approaches. 

## Goals
An important skill that all NLP researchers and practitioners must have is being able to critically read papers. Just because a paper has been presented at a conference or published on a journal, it does not necessarily mean that it is flawless. We, as responsible readers, must be able to understand the methodology, evaluate the approach and build upon the work of our colleagues to improve our field. Besides becoming up-to-date with the applications of RL in NLP, the purpose of this course is also helping students getting used to constructively assessing and discussing scientific literature.

*Disclaimer*: due to the format of the course and the limited time, this course will not teach Reinforcement Learning *per se*. The main abstract concepts will come up in the discussions, but if you wish to learn its mathematical foundations or algorithms in detail, take a look, e.g. at [David Silver's video-lectures](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/), [Emma Brunskill's course](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/index.html) and the [reference book by Sutton & Barto](https://opac.ub.uni-potsdam.de/DB=1/SET=2/TTL=1/SHW?FRST=1). 

## Format
We will work as "reviewers for one week". Each week, one participant pretends to be an NLP conference reviewer and writes a text in the form of a blog post, following the guidelines below, about one of the papers in the bibliography. This will be posted on Moodle together with three topics you propose for group discussion in the forum. Throughout the week, everyone takes part on the debate at least once. Then you and I meet virtually for a short spontaneous talk about your impressions. In the end of the semester, you will work on an essay as part of the final grade.

:warning: If you are considering taking this seminar, please write me an e-mail or register in the Moodle course, to help me plan our schedule. You can also tell me if you have any preference regarding the papers in the bibliography, or suggest a paper that is note cited there yet. :warning: 

## Background 
Everyone is welcome to take this class, but you will profit more if you are already familiar with the main NLP tasks and methods. Watching the online courses I mention above is also a great help. If you are in doubt, contact me :)

## Grading
Grading will be based on your participation on the discussions, your paper review and the final project.

## Formalities
Step-by-step guidelines (these are current ideas, they may be changed until the beginning of the course).

During the first week of the course, I will publish the schedule with papers and reviewers here. The cycle will be as follows:

Every participant is a debater except during the week when she/he is a reviewer. Each one of you will be the reviewer once, working on one paper of your choice.

**Reviewer**
1) Your scheduled Monday before 11:59 a.m.: send me your review and 3 discussion topics.
2) Following Friday at 3:00 p.m.: we meet online; come prepared to first hold a 15-minute talk where you tell me your impressions on the group discussion.

  Your post should be written on markdown style.

**Debater**
1) Monday before 11:59 a.m.: skim through the current week's paper (read at least the abstract, introduction, conclusion) and send me a two-paragraph text.
2) Anytime before Friday at 11:59 a.m.: post at least one contribution to the discussion on Moodle. This should be pertinent to the development of the discussion so far and consist of at least 200 words. 


Reviewer for a week: each participant chooses a paper from the bibliography. You pretend you are a reviewer in a big conference and evaulate the paper. Then, you write a text in the form of a blog post discussing the accomplishments and limitations of the paper, together with a short review on other approaches for solving the same task and suggestion for future work. This should be done aiming at a public that is not familiar with the field. Provide 3 topics for discussion that will be carried out by your colleagues during the week. Then we meet virtually for a 10-15 minute private talk, when you tell me about your impressions on the discussion.
