# Seminar: Reinforcement Learning for Natural Language Processing


|-------------:|---------------------------|
| Instructor   | Brielen Madureira         |
| Time and location | Online |
| Duration | 20.04.2020 - 20.07.2020 |

## Description
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm that is becoming more popular for Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this seminar, we will cover recent literature that apply RL to different NLP tasks, discussing how NLP problems can be modeled with RL concepts and comparing the results to other traditional or common approaches. 

## Goals
An important skill that all NLP researchers and practitioners must have is being able to critically read papers. Just because a paper has been presented at a conference or published on a journal, it does not necessarily mean that it is flawless. We, as responsible readers, must understand the methodology, evaluate the approach and build upon the work of our colleagues to improve our field. Besides becoming up-to-date with the applications of RL in NLP, the purpose of this course is also helping students getting used to constructively assessing and discussing scientific literature.

Disclaimer: due to the format of the course and the limited time, this course will not teach Reinforcement Learning per se. The main abstract concepts will come up in the discussions, but if you wish to learn its mathematical foundations or algorithms in detail, take a look, e.g. at [David Silver's video-lectures](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/) and [Emma Brunskill's course](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/index.html). 

## Format
Reviewer for a week: each participant chooses a paper from the bibliography. You pretend you are a reviewer in a big conference and evaulate the paper. Then, you write a text in the form of a blog post discussing the accomplishments and limitations of the paper, together with a short review on other approaches for solving the same task and suggestion for future work. This should be done aiming at a public that is not familiar with the field. Provide 3 topics for discussion that will be carried out by your colleagues during the week. Then we meet virtually for a 10-15 minute private talk, when you tell me about your impressions on the discussion.

Because this seminar had to be converted to an online format due to the current situation, I welcome your suggestions on how to improve it. 

## Background 
Everyone is welcome to take this class, but you will profit more if you are already familiar with the main NLP tasks and methods. Watching the online courses I mention above is also a great help. If you are in doubt, contact me :)

### Grading
Grading will be based on your participation on the discussions, your paper review and the final project.
