:warning: If you are considering taking this seminar, please write me an e-mail and register in the Moodle course, to help me plan our schedule. You can also tell me if you have any preferences regarding the papers in the bibliography, or suggest a paper that is note cited there yet. :warning: 

## Description
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm that is becoming more popular for Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this seminar, we will cover recent literature that apply RL to different NLP tasks, discussing how NLP problems can be modeled with RL concepts and comparing the results to other traditional or common approaches. 

## Goals
An important skill that all NLP researchers and practitioners must have is being able to critically read papers. Just because a paper has been presented at a conference or published on a journal, it does not necessarily mean that it is flawless. We, as responsible readers, must be able to understand the methodology, evaluate the approach and build upon the work of our colleagues to improve our field. Besides becoming up-to-date with the applications of RL in NLP, the purpose of this course is also helping students getting used to constructively assessing and discussing scientific literature.

*Disclaimer*: due to the format of the course and the limited time, this course will not teach Reinforcement Learning *per se*. The main abstract concepts will come up in the discussions, but if you wish to learn its mathematical foundations or algorithms in detail, take a look, e.g. at [David Silver's video-lectures](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/), [Emma Brunskill's course](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/index.html) and the [reference book by Sutton & Barto](https://opac.ub.uni-potsdam.de/DB=1/SET=2/TTL=1/SHW?FRST=1). 

## Format
We will work as "reviewers for one week". Each week, one participant pretends to be an NLP conference reviewer and writes a text in the form of a blog post, following the guidelines below, about one of the papers in the bibliography. This will be posted on Moodle together with three topics you propose for group discussion in the forum. Throughout the week, everyone takes part on the debate at least once. Then you and I meet virtually for a short spontaneous talk about your impressions. In the end of the semester, you will work on an essay as part of the final grade. See details on the guidelines.

## Background 
Everyone is welcome to take this class, but you will profit more if you are already familiar with the main NLP tasks and methods. Watching the online courses I mention above is also a great help. If you are in doubt, contact me :)

## Requirements and grading policy
 1) one complete paper review and proposal of 3 discussion topics (40% of final grade)
 2) active participation on the discussion forums every week (20% of final grade)
 3) final project (term paper or a Python program + report) (40% of final grade)
 
 To pass the course, you must achieve a performance of at least 60% **on each of the items above separately**.
 
 See details on the guidelines.
