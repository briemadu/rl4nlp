## Guidelines
Detailed guidelines for this seminar (these are current ideas, they may be changed until the beginning of the course).

Each one of you will be the blogger once during the semester, working on one paper of your choice. Every participant is always a debater in the audience except during the week when she/he is a blogger. 

During the first week of the course, I will publish the schedule with papers and assigned participants, based on those who have enroled at Moodle (so please do it) and as far as possible on your preferences. 

In the first (probably 2) weeks there will be no bloggers: I have posted the introductory articles we will read together and I will propose the discussion topics, but your role as audience is already expected as of April 20.

# Blogger
**Duties**
 * After carefully reading the paper assigned to you, write a blog post about it and send it to me by email as a pdf file on **Monday before 11:59 a.m**.
 * In the body of your e-mail, write three discussion topics. I will immediately publish these on Moodle.
 * You have to interact with your peers during the week. It does not mean you must be online 24 hours and answer straight away, but you have to be present everyday, answer questions, reply to comments etc.
 * On Friday, we meet online at 3 p.m. for a 15-minute talk. I wish to hear from you what you have learned, the difficulties you have faced and you impressions on the forum debates. This is an informal talk, so don't worry about preparing any material, but be ready to spontaneously talk about the content you worked with.
 
**Instructions**
* Your blog post should have not less than 3,000 words. Assume your audience is familiar with NLP, but not at all with your paper. Be creative: the style may be more informal and pedagogical; you can use pictures, memes, examples etc.
* The post **must** include the following:
 - title and author
 - begin with a TL;DR (max 100 words)
 - briefly describe the NLP task the paper is trying to solve and other methods people have been using apart from RL
 - explain what the authors of the paper have done
 - especially explain how the ideas of RL have been used to model the task (e.g. how was was the reward translated into NLP concepts?)
 - mention good aspects and accomplishments of the paper; which ideas did you find interesting and why?
 - criticize the paper; which ideas did you disagree with? how would you change that?
 - propose some suggestions for a follow-up research
 
 
# Audience
**Duties**
* skim through the current week's paper (read at least the abstract, introduction, conclusion) 
* anytime before **Friday at 11:59 a.m.**, post at least one contribution to the discussion on Moodle. This should be pertinent to the development of the discussion so far and consist of at least 250 words (which can be splitted among different comments). You may ask questions, politely disagree with the blogger, suggest improvements, support the author or blogger with more evidence, recommend material etc. Remember it is the participation (not the correctness) that counts on the grade, a relevant comment is fine even if it is not 100% right.

# Final project
You can choose between writing a complete literature review on RL applications for NLP or implementing (Python code+report) an RL algorithm to handle an NLP task and running experiments. Detailed instructions will be posted soon.
