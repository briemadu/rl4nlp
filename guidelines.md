## Formalities
Step-by-step guidelines (these are current ideas, they may be changed until the beginning of the course).

During the first week of the course, I will publish the schedule with papers and reviewers here. The cycle will be as follows:

Every participant is a debater except during the week when she/he is a reviewer. Each one of you will be the reviewer once, working on one paper of your choice.

**Reviewer**
1) Your scheduled Monday before 11:59 a.m.: send me your review and 3 discussion topics.
2) Following Friday at 3:00 p.m.: we meet online; come prepared to first hold a 15-minute talk where you tell me your impressions on the group discussion.


**Debater**
1) Monday before 11:59 a.m.: skim through the current week's paper (read at least the abstract, introduction, conclusion) and send me a two-paragraph text.
2) Anytime before Friday at 11:59 a.m.: post at least one contribution to the discussion on Moodle. This should be pertinent to the development of the discussion so far and consist of at least 200 words. 


Reviewer for a week: each participant chooses a paper from the bibliography. You pretend you are a reviewer in a big conference and evaulate the paper. Then, you write a text in the form of a blog post discussing the accomplishments and limitations of the paper, together with a short review on other approaches for solving the same task and suggestion for future work. This should be done aiming at a public that is not familiar with the field. Provide 3 topics for discussion that will be carried out by your colleagues during the week. Then we meet virtually for a 10-15 minute private talk, when you tell me about your impressions on the discussion.
